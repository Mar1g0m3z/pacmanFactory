# pacmanFactory

In this project we make a pacman factory. Using javascript to make two buttons. One to create more pacmen, the other one to start the movement and bouncing of each. 
The code also allows for change in image direction as well as continuous opening and closing of the pacman mouth. 
I hope to be able have different color pacman to appear as well.
To get this running please download the files. 
All png and background was drawn by me.
